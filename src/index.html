        <p>To save you from reading an elaborate intro, I’m just going to cut to the chase. Today I'm sharing all of the things I
        wish I had known before travelling to Poland. From things I wish I had researched better, to things I wish people had
        told me and things I hope will help anyone headed to this beautiful country. Because if you love to travel but could do
        without Europe's overrated destinations, you'll be pleasantly surprised in Poland.</p>
        <p><img src="http://placehold.it/660x150"></p>
        <h2>1. THEY DON'T USE EURO IN POLAND</h2>
        <p>I should have known that, despite being in the European Union, Poland does not use euro. The national currency in Poland
        is <em>złoty</em> (pronounced zwoty) and a quick google search would have told me so. Instead, I didn't find out until the night
        before we left for Poland which, I'll admit, was a rookie mistake. <em>Złoty</em> is abbreviated as PLN or zł and <em>groszy</em> is the
        equivalent to cents in Poland. The odd hotel or restaurant may accept euro or dollars but ATM's and exchange counters
        can be found throughout the country so you won't have a problem getting local currency.</p>
        <h2>2. YES, THEY SPEAK ENGLISH</h2>
        <p>After their native tongue, English is the second most common language spoken in Poland. It's taught in schools and
        almost anyone working in the tourism industry of a big city speaks English to some degree. You may not hear it in small
        towns and among older locals but you'll get by just fine in the country's top tourist destinations. And while I can
        attest to the fact that many speak English, I've also witnessed that, if asked, many pretend not to understand when shy
        or afraid to reveal their accent. I heard <em>"Sorry for my bad English"</em> quite often despite their English being much better
        than my Polish.</p>
        <h2>3. IT WON'T HURT YOU TO LEARN POLISH</h2>
        <p>After visiting the country twice now, Wes and I have learned a few words and phrases to help us get by. Knowing some
        basic greetings when visiting a new country will go a long way and came in handy for us when travelling off the beaten
        path to cities like Tarnów and Łódź. However, I can't say Polish is an easy language to learn. I stopped trying to sound
        out the overwhelming number of sz's cz's and dz's in the language and instead focus on how Polish words are spoken. It
        was much easier for me to ask a local how to say 'excuse me' in Polish than to try and figure out how in the heck to
        pronounce the word <em>'przepraszam'</em>. To save you the headache, it sounds like <em>shep-rush-am</em>.</p>
        <h2>4. MILK BARS ARE NOT BARS THAT SELL MILK</h2>
        <p>Ok, you can't blame me for assuming here! Contrary to the name, milk bars (or <em>bar mleczny</em> in Polish) are affordable,
        cafeteria-style restaurants that you'll find throughout Poland. In the past, milk bars were subsidized by the government
        for workers but today you can visit one and find complete, homemade-style meals for as little as $2-3 CAD. Our visits to
        milk bars included a lot of guesswork and some miming but it's an experience we would recommend to anyone travelling to
        Poland.</p>
        <h2>5. YOU WILL BE EATING MORE THAN JUST PIEROGI</h2>
        <p>If you had asked me two years ago to name one Polish food other than <em>pierogi</em>, I wouldn’t have been able to give you an
        answer. Today I can tell you not to leave Poland without having (at least) tried <em>bigos</em>, <em>borscht</em>, <em>żurek</em>, <em>kopytka</em>,
        <em>gołąbki</em>, <em>placki ziemniaczane</em> and <em>zapiekanka</em>. But despite all of the delicious food to be had in Poland, I have to admit
        pierogi is what I look forward to having first!</p>

        <h2>6. YOU WILL DRINK MORE THAN JUST VODKA</h2>
        <p>Another stereotype we've all heard is that Polish people only drink vodka. And, while we did have our fair share in
        Poland, there is more to be enjoyed. Like beer. Often ranking in the top 10 for world's biggest beer drinkers, beer is
        no joke in Poland. Żywiec and Tyskie aside, there's an impressive craft beer scene growing in cities all over the
        country. I was pleasantly surprised to nearly always find a local IPA in bars, eateries and grocery stores. It's worth
        noting that, unlike neighbouring Germany and Czechia, drinking in public is not allowed in Poland. This is also where
        Wes and I first got a taste of kompot: a deliciously sweet beverage made with fruit and served either hot or cold
        (depending on the season).</p>
        <h2>7. THE BUILDINGS ARE NOT DULL AND GREY</h2>
        <p><img src="http://placehold.it/660x150"></p>
        <p>There are, regrettably, many people in this world who still think of Poland as a bleak country full of gloomy cities and
        run-down buildings when that's just not true. Not even in the underappreciated city of Katowice. Instead, what you'll
        find are beautiful town squares complete with colourful buildings, cobblestone roads and an undeniable European charm.
        If I had to pick, Poznań and Wrocław have my favourite old towns. But Krakow's main square is beautiful too. And then
        there's Toruń, Gdańsk... You see, they're all beautiful in their own right.</p>
        <h2>8. BE PREPARED TO MEET THE MOST HOSPITABLE PEOPLE</h2>
        <p>Just the other day, our friend Marta (from the YouTube channel Marticore) asked Wes to participate in her next "Tweets
        about Polish People" video. It's a funny video series about exactly that and we were asked to address the tweet: "I'm
        thinking of moving to Poland. I wonder if Polish people are welcoming." In short, Polish people share that same
        <em>feed-you-till-you-have-to-unbutton-your-pants</em> level of hospitality that we've found in countries all over the world. You
        may inevitably cross paths with a grumpy shop owner but, in our case, we've encountered some of the most welcoming
        people in Poland. Maybe even too welcoming...</p>
        <h2>9. MAKE TIME TO TRAVEL BEYOND WARSAW</h2>
        <img src="http://placehold.it/144x150">
        <p>If Poland has made it's way on to your travel list, you've likely made plans to visit Warsaw. Maybe even Kraków. I'd
        really encourage you to make time for some of the other well-preserved cities though. In my opinion, Wrocław, Poznań and
        Gdansk are worthy of making their way onto a first-timer's itinerary. If it weren't for the dozens of recommendations we
        were getting from viewers, we might not have had the chance to discover so many of Poland's beautiful cities.</p>
